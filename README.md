# Simple Calculator

## About

This project is an implementation of a simple calculator UI using C++ in conjunction with Qt. The calculator has only simple mathematical features, including adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying floating point numbers. Additionally, a user can clear the selection, and display results.

## Versioning

**VERSION:** 1.0

**RELEASE:** N/A

**LAST UPDATED:** April 24th, 2018

## Resources

**main.cpp:** Contains everything required to run the UI.

**calculator.h:** Header file for **calculator.c** containing class, container, and prototype definitions.

**calculator.c:** Contains everything required to implement functionality for the UI.

**mainwindow.ui:** The UI, created in Qt Designer.

## How To Use

The system requires qmake for qt4 to run. It can be installed on Linux Ubuntu (and related systems) with `sudo apt-get install qt4-default`.

To use the system:
1. Run the following to generate an executable:
```
qmake-qt4 -project
qmake-qt4
make
```
2. The executable will be generated with the name of the repository. In this case, **simple-calculator**. To run the executable run `./simple-calculator`.
3. Run `make clean` to clean up all of the miscellaneous files generated by qmake.

## Future Development

No future development is planned at this time.
